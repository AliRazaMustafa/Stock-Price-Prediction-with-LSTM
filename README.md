# Stock-Price-Prediction-with-LSTM
Predicting stock prices is tough because financial markets are complex and unpredictable. But with machine learning, especially deep learning, we can now build models that find patterns in stock price data and make accurate predictions. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a kind of recurrent neural network.
