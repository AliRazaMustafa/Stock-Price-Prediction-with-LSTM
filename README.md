# Stock-Price-Prediction-with-LSTM
Predicting stock prices is tough because financial markets are complex and unpredictable. But with machine learning, especially deep learning, we can now build models that find patterns in stock price data and make accurate predictions. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a kind of recurrent neural network, have shown good results in predicting time series data, including stock prices.

**Objectives:**
The main goal of this project is to create an LSTM-based model to predict stock prices using past data. Specific goals include:
1.	Gather and clean stock price data for a chosen company or index.
2.	Build and train an LSTM model to predict future stock prices from historical data.
3.	Measure the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
4.	Compare the LSTM model's performance with traditional methods like Moving Average (MA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA).
5.	Improve the LSTM model by adjusting settings and trying different designs.

**Methodology:**
The project will follow these steps:
1.	Data Collection and Preprocessing:
•	Collect historical stock price data for the chosen company or index.
•	Clean the data and handle any missing values or outliers.
•	Split the data into training and testing sets.

**2.	LSTM Model Development:**
•	Design the LSTM model, including the number of layers and activation functions.
•	Train the LSTM model with the training data.
•	Monitor and validate the model using a validation set.

**3.	Model Evaluation:**
•	Test the trained LSTM model on the testing set using MSE and MAPE.
•	Compare the LSTM model's performance with MA and EMA methods.

**4.	Model Optimization:**
•	Experiment with different LSTM designs, such as adding more layers.
•	Adjust settings like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
•	Check how these changes affect the model's performance.

**5.	Result Analysis and Documentation:**
•	Analyze the results and compare the optimized LSTM model with other methods.
•	Document the project, including methods, results, and conclusions.

**Expected Outcomes:**
By the end of this project, we aim to have an LSTM model that can accurately predict stock prices using past data. The model will be evaluated and compared with traditional forecasting methods, and its performance will be improved through testing and tuning.

**Conclusion:**
Using LSTM networks for stock price prediction can offer valuable insights for investors and traders. This project aims to develop an effective LSTM model and compare its performance with traditional methods. We will also explore ways to make the LSTM model more accurate and reliable.
